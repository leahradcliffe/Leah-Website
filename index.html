        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Welcome! My name is Leah Radcliffe, I’m currently a third year Information Systems major at the University of Cincinnati. I started at the University of Dayton in 2021 studying Mechanical Engineering. During my time there, I delved into the realms of molecules, structures, robotics, and coding through my coursework.
            I was fortunate enough to embark on a transfer to the University of Chaminade of Honolulu, where I had the privilege to engage in activities such as surfing, diving, and daily moped rides. A point of pride for me is the resilience I have cultivated through my various academic transitions. While mechanical engineering initially held promise, it became evident that it wasn’t a perfect fit.
            It is in my current academic pursuit at the University of Cincinnati that I have discovered my true passion. The realms of data interpretation, databases, coding, Excel, queries, and all aspects of business resonate with me deeply. Each class I attend fuels my enthusiasm, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my major and explore its myriad facets with genuine joy.
            </p>
            <p>     In an effort to chronicle my journey and document my growth, I have crafted this website using HTML. I am excited about the opportunities and discoveries I will make ahead.</p>
